Framework Types:
BDD - Behavioral Driven Development (ATDD) (A = Acceptance)
TDD - Test Driven Development

Acceptance Criteria: (Requirement)
Validate : Requirement == actual functionalities

Requirement:
When user logged in to the system
System should greets the user like 'Welcome <userName>'

Acceptance Criteria: (Behavior of the system)
1. Scenario: (Gherkin format)
Given user in the homePage
When user logged in to the system
Then System greets 'Welcome <userName>'

Test Cases:
Happy path/Positive Testing - When a valid user logged in, system should say 'Welcome <username>'
Negative Testing - When invalid user try to logged in, system should not greets the user
Negative Testing - When empty/null user try to logged in, system should not greets

Bug - Funtionalities that do not go along with requirement
Requirement != actual functionalities

Smoke Test - Major / Base functionalities
Regression Test - All available tests

Gherkin format is a plain text format with pre-defined syntax at the beginning.

Gherkin Syntax/Keyword:
- Feature
- Given (Pre-Defined status)
- When (Action)
- Then (Assertion / Validation)
- And
- Background
- Scenario
- Scenario Outline
- Example
- *

Feature File: 
Will start with Feature syntax and followed by Scenario/Scenario Outline with Given When Then (Gherkin Syntax) with .feature extension

Step Definition: Actual code implementation
Gerkin steps == java test steps
